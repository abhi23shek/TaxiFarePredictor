Taxi Fare Predictor
Project Overview
The Taxi Fare Predictor project aims to predict the fare of a taxi ride in New York City based on various features such as pickup and dropoff locations, the number of passengers, and the date and time of the ride. The project uses a machine learning model to perform the predictions, with a focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is TaxiFare.csv, which includes the following columns:

unique_id: Unique identifier for each ride (dropped during preprocessing)
amount: The fare amount for the ride
date_time_of_pickup: The date and time when the ride was initiated
longitude_of_pickup: The longitude of the pickup location
latitude_of_pickup: The latitude of the pickup location
longitude_of_dropoff: The longitude of the dropoff location
latitude_of_dropoff: The latitude of the dropoff location
no_of_passenger: The number of passengers in the ride
Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the necessary libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

Import necessary libraries.
Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Drop unnecessary columns.
Check the dataset's shape and data types.
Feature Engineering and Model Training:

Perform feature engineering to prepare data for model training.
Train a RandomForestRegressor model to predict taxi fares.
Running the Project
Clone the repository or download the TaxiFarePredictor.ipynb notebook.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, and train the model.
The model's performance metrics will be displayed towards the end of the notebook.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict taxi fares using various features. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using scikit-learn's RandomForestRegressor.

Future Work
Explore additional features that could improve the model's accuracy, such as weather conditions or traffic data.
Experiment with other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
Deploy the model as a web service for real-time fare prediction.
